            <p class="p-style2" data-aos="fade-left">
              Marie Curie's scientific journey truly began when she chose to investigate the mysterious phenomenon of
              radioactivity, a term she later coined. Inspired by the discoveries of Wilhelm Roentgen (X-rays) and Henri
              Becquerel (uranium's spontaneous emission of radiation), Curie focused her attention on substances that
              emitted similar invisible rays. Her pioneering work would not only change the course of physics and
              chemistry but would also have profound effects on medicine and technology

            <p class="p-style2" data-aos="fade-right">
              While systematically studying the mineral pitchblende, Curie noted that the material was significantly
              more radioactive than could be accounted for by its uranium content alone. She hypothesized that another,
              unknown element was contributing to the radioactivity. After months of laborious work, including grinding
              and chemically separating components, Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre Curie, announced in July 1898
              the discovery of a new element, which they named polonium, after her beloved homeland, Poland. This was an
              extraordinary achievement, as isolating a new element required exceptional patience, skill, and
              innovation, particularly with the crude laboratory equipment of the time.

            <p class="p-style2" data-aos="fade-right">
              Encouraged by the discovery of polonium, the Curies continued to refine pitchblende and, by December 1898,
              identified yet another radioactive element, radium. Unlike polonium, radium was found in much larger
              quantities, which allowed for more extensive study. Radium's intense radioactivity astonished the
              scientific world. Marie Curie was instrumental in extracting radium chloride in its pure form, a
              groundbreaking accomplishment that required processing tons of pitchblende residue. The dazzling blue glow
              of radium salts captured the imagination of scientists.

            <p class="p-style2" data-aos="fade-up-right">
              Marie Curie, a pioneering physicist and chemist, coined the term "radioactivity" in the late 19th century
              to describe the spontaneous emission of energy from certain elements. While studying uranium and thorium,
              she noticed that these substances emitted invisible rays that could pass through solid objects and affect
              photographic plates. Curie's groundbreaking work not only gave a name to this mysterious phenomenon but
              also laid the foundation for the field of nuclear physics

              Curie and Henri Becquerel, becoming the first woman ever to receive a Nobel Prize. Her contributions,
              however, did not stop there. In 1911, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of
              radium and polonium, her investigation into their properties, and her success in isolating radium. She
              remains the only person to have won Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields.

            <p class="p-style "  data-aos="zoom-in-down">

              At the outset of her scientific journey, Marie Curie faced profound struggles that tested her resilience.
              As a
              woman in the late 19th century, gaining access to advanced scientific education was a rare privilege.
              Curie
              fought against deep-rooted societal prejudices that believed scientific pursuits were unsuitable for
              women.
              Financial hardships further compounded her difficulties. She had to work long hours, tutoring and taking
              up
              odd
              jobs to fund her studies, often sacrificing her own comfort and health. While studying at the Sorbonne in
              Paris,
              she lived in poor conditions—often going without food and suffering from extreme cold in her small rented
              rooms.
              Despite these physical and emotional hardships, Curie's dedication to scientific inquiry never wavered.
              She
              spent long hours in rudimentary laboratories, conducting experiments with limited resources, determined to
              uncover the hidden secrets of nature.

            <p class="p-style " data-aos="zoom-in-right">
              Marie Curie's tireless efforts bore fruit when, in 1903, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics,
              alongside
              Henri Becquerel and Pierre Curie, for their groundbreaking work on radioactivity. Despite her major role
              in
              the research, initial considerations for the prize did not include her. It was only after strong advocacy
              by
              her
              colleagues that her contributions were acknowledged. Winning the Nobel Prize was a momentous achievement
              not
              only for Curie personally but also for women in science, as she became the first woman to ever receive a
              Nobel
              Prize. This recognition validated the years of struggle and perseverance she had endured to establish
              herself
              in the male-dominated world of physics.

              Marie Curie’s achievements did not stop there. In 1911, she won her second Nobel Prize, this time in
              Chemistry,
              for her discovery of the elements polonium and radium and for developing methods to isolate radioactive
              isotopes. This honor made her the first person ever to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific
              fields.
              However, even at this peak of success, Curie faced hostility and skepticism, fueled by nationalism,
              sexism,
              and
              personal attacks. Undeterred, she continued her groundbreaking research, driven by a deep commitment to
              scientific advancement and humanitarian service.

                    ASCANDAL-DRIVEN PRESS is not a recent phenomenon. Pierre and Marie had been hounded by intrusive reporters
                    as early as 1902, when news began to circulate about the medical uses of radium. After they won the Nobel
                    Prize, reporters redoubled their attentions. But until late 1910 most press coverage of Marie Curie focused
                    on the heroic labors of the blonde, foreign-born mother, wife, and then widow. Some of the press changed its
                    tune, however, in November 1910, when Curie offered herself as a candidate for the single vacant seat for a
                    physicist in the French Academy of  Her main rival for the seat was 66-year-old Edouard Branly, whose scientific reputation was based on his contribution to wireless telegraphy. When Italian Gugliemo Marconi was awarded the 1909 Nobel Prize for Physics for his work in that field, many French patriots felt stung by Branly's exclusion.

        AN EVEN WORSE SCANDAL was to erupt before the end of 1911. That a woman who was left a widow at 38 should become romantically attached again is not surprising. But when Curie's relationship with fellow physicist Paul Langevin moved beyond friendly collegiality to mutual love, she could not foresee where it would lead. Langevin, a brilliant former pupil of Pierre's, was unhappily married to a woman who came from a similar working-class background but lacked his educational attainments. With four children to raise, Madame Langevin complained that Paul placed his commitment to science above the needs of his family.

“They can't comprehend at his house that he refuses magnificent situations...in private industry to dedicate himself to science,” wrote a friend of Langevin's. During the summer of 1911, as rumors about a relationship between Curie and Langevin began to spread, Madame Langevin began proceedings to bring about a legal separation.

              M </span> arie Curie passed away on July 4, 1934, in Sancellemoz Sanatorium in Passy, France, from
            aplastic anemia, a
            condition in which the bone marrow fails to produce sufficient new blood cells. This disease was almost
            certainly caused by her prolonged and repeated exposure to ionizing radiation during her scientific
            research.<br>

            At the time, the health risks of radioactivity were unknown. Curie and her husband Pierre often handled
            radioactive materials like radium and polonium without protective gear. She frequently carried radioactive
            samples in her coat pockets and stored them in her lab and home, fascinated by their glowing appearance.
            Over
            the years, this unshielded exposure damaged her bone marrow and likely led to the onset of her fatal
            illness.<br>

            Her death not only underscored the dangers of radiation but also marked a pivotal point in the development
            of
            radiation safety protocols. Despite the personal cost, her legacy lives on in her revolutionary
            contributions to
            physics, chemistry, and medical science.
